<h2 id="About Me">Background</h2>
	<p> My name is Brianna Armstrong. I am a young professional currently pursuing education in
	Software development and IT. At twenty-three years old the world is full opportunities. 
	I would call myself a true adventurer. Recently I decided to take a leap of faith with my career goals by leaving my corporate job in order
	to pursue my education in IT. The Cleveland Codes program has alloted me the opportunity to do so. 
	and it has helped me greatly in my personal life as well as my professional life.
	My previous work experience has allowed me to explore many different avenues. 
	I possess a strong background in education, working with children and adults with disabilite.
	Also, with a history of working in the consumer goods industry as well as in Personal Lines Insurance.
	By taking this leap of faith it has welcomed me to the journey of software development and I am excited to see 
	how far I can go. </p>
	
<h2 id="Hobbies_/_Interests">Hobbies &amp; Interests</h2>	
	<p>In my spare time I have a few hobbies I really enjoy. 
	<ul> 
	   <li> One of them being <em> writing </em>. I write in a journal daily and I often write poetry.
		Through websites such as <b>GoodReads</b> and <b>TheMighty</b> I have several published articles online.
		Writing helps me stay grounded by reflecting on my life and allowing me to express my creativity. </li> 
	   <li> I find that <em>exercise</em> keep me healthy physically and even mentally. For example,
		After a yoga class my mind always feels at ease. It is wonderful for stress relief and helps
		when I am boggled down with work or school.
	   </li>
